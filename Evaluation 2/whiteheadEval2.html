    For Evaluation 2, I will be examining the
    <a href="https://www.forsyth.cc/library/Central/" alt= "Link to the Forsyth
    County Central Library" title= "Link to the Forsyth County Central Library"
    target=" blank"> Forsyth Country Central Library website. </a>
    Upon entering the page, you are greeted with many links.
    The header of the page has 6 links, 5 of which are drop down menus.
    They are:
    <ol>
      <li> Library </li>
      <li> Branch Home </li>
      <li> Departments </li>
      <li> Services </li>
      <li> Resources </li>
      <li> All Locations </li>
    </ol>
    At the very top of the header, there are also links to other city websites,
    such as:
    <ul>
     <li> “forsyth.cc" </li>
     <li> Departments </li>
     <li> Online Services </li>
     <li> Community Info </li>
  <br>
  <p>
    The home page of the Central Library website feels a bit cluttered and busy.
    As the eye moves down the page, you can see several clearly defined,
    but poorly labeled sections.
    <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    First in the upper left corner, taking the majority of the page is 6
    links that pertain to recent library news and upcoming events. On the right
    side of the page is a list of resources for the users.
    These are all primarily utility in nature. They are:
    <ol>
      <li> Location and Hours </li>
      <li> Ask You Librarian </li>
      <li> Search the Catalogue </li>
      <li> Newsletter </li>
      <li> Calendar of Events </li>
      <li> Download Media </li>
      <li> Kid’s Page </li>
      <li> Online Resources </li>
      <li> Friends of the Library </li>
      <li> Teen’s Page </li>
      <li> Reserve a Meeting Room </li>
      <li> Upcoming Classes </li>
      <li> Reader’s Page </li>
      <li> Homework Help </li>
      <li> Closings </li>
      <li> Social Media Links </li>
    </ol>
  <br>
  <p>
    On the left side of the page, below the Library News section, there is a
    scrolling section showing the covers of new book releases.
    <img src="/Users/Jake/Documents/GitHub/Marx-and-Recreation/New Releases and Footer.png"
     alt="Screenshot of The New Releases and Footer Sections" title="New
     Releases and Footer Sections">
    <br>
    Finally, there is the footer of the page, which is divided into 4 sections:
    <ol>
      <li> County Services </li>
      <li> Our Latest Tweets </li>
      <li> Contact Us </li>
      <li> A Location Widget </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This website is designed for a myriad of users. This is indicated by the
      amount of different resources that are available on the main page.
      However, it seems that one large user base is students as there are
      several resources that are specifically dedicated to assistance with
      homework, as well as specific age groups that are typically in the school
      system. Other tasks that this websites facilitates are:
      <ul>
        <li> notifying the user of community events held in the library </li>
        <li> Allowing users to browse the catalogue </li>
        <li> Aiding users in academic help (even if they re not in school) </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      While at first glance the page seems, cluttered, it is organized in a
      distinct way that allows patrons to locate the resources they are looking
      for. For example, I will demonstrate how to find career help. It is not
      directly advertised on the website and thus is more difficult to find,
      but it does exist.
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li> Near the bottom of the right hand section, click on the
          “Live Homework Help” link. <img src="/Users/Jake/Documents/GitHub/Marx-and-Recreation/Live Homework Help 1.png"
          alt="Live Homework Help Screenshot" title="Live Homework Help"> </li>
        <li> This brings you to the Forsyth County Public Library tutor.com site.

        <li> From there, select the “topic” drop down menu and you can find a
          heading that says “Job help”.

        <li> Select your grade (you have the option to select “adult”
          if you are not a student)

        <li> Finally, enter your question in the input box and click the big
          green “Connect Now” button to begin working with a live tutor.

      </ol>
      This is an easy feature to use and can be utilized by people in all manner
       of different circumstances, from homework help to job help, as demonstrated.
       A note of importance, however, is that a Forsyth County Library
       card is required to use this feature.
