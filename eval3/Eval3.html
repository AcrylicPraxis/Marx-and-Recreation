  <p>
    For the purposes of Evaluation 3, I will be conducting an examination of
    the <a href="https://www.library.ucsb.edu" alt= "Link to the UCSB Davidson
    Library Website" title= "Link to the Davidson Library Website"
    target=" blank"> University of California, Santa Barbara’s Davidson Library
    website. </a> In order to do this, I will be utilizing
    Garrett’s 5 Planes of User Experience Design and applying those principles
    to the Davidson Library website.
  </p>
  <br>
<b> Section I: Surface </b>
  <p>
    To begin analyzing the Davidson Library website, we will start with the
    top-most layer of Garrett’s planes - the Surface.
    The surface deals with sensory design which is used to engage the user’s
    senses when interacting with the website. However, as it is difficult, or
    even impossible to engage all of the sense, there should naturally be a
    focus on how the eye engages with the site.
  <br>
    The layout of the site facilitates a smooth eye-flow from top to bottom
    and left to right, as the eye naturally wants to do (at least for a
    western reader).

    alt="Eye Movement Pattern" title="Eye Motion on Home Page">
  <br>
    There are open spaces that give the design an
    unrestricted feel and there are 4 distinct sections:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Library Search
      </li>
      <li>
        Library Resources
      </li>
      <li>
        News
      </li>
      <li>
        Events
      </li>
    </ol>
     Each section has its own design and function.
  <br>
    The four sections clearly indicate that they contain different types of
    information. Each has links to to different resources available in their
    sections and is easily navigable.
  </p>
  <br>
<b> Section II: Skeleton </b>
  <p>
    The Skeleton layer deals with interface, navigation, and information design.
  <br>
    The interface, as mentioned previously, is divided into four sections.
    They each communicate different information, and each in different ways.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first section has a unique box to the left of the search bar that
        allows the user to search different resources. The search bar changes
        correspondingly to the box selection.
      </li>
  <br>
      <li>
        The second section has two distinct bars of information - one on library
        hours, another on services available in the library. The second bar in
        the section has interactable links for the different services.
      </li>
  <br>
      <li>
        The third section, focusing on news, has a series of bees that are links
        to news articles with arrow buttons to the left and right of the section
        allowing the user to scroll through the listed announcements.
      </li>
  <br>
      <li>
        The fourth section, events and exhibitions, is divided into two blocks.
        The left block has a series of dates and the events listed for them.
        Each of the dates is a clickable link that takes the suer to a different
        page with more information. The right box has scrolling series of
        available exhibitions and is navigable via arrows on the left and right
        of the box. The navigation is mixed into the interface, effectively
        blending the two and gives it a natural feel.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <br>
    <p><!--Needs a <p> Tag -->Regarding information design, the sections clearly indicate the types of
    information that is available within them and is clearly indicated to the
    user.</p><!--Zack: I feel like there is more to say here. -->
  </p>
  <br>
<b> Section III Structure </b>
  <p>
    The third plane, Structure is split into Interaction Design, and
    Information Architecture and mostly approaches how the page is interacted
    with by users and how the system will respond to  the user’s behavior.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    One thing that stands out to me is that my instinct is to think that the
    library hours bar would have clickable links, but it has none and that
    feels odd. Instead, it has a drop-down menu that offers more information.</p>
    <img src="HoursMenu.png"
    alt="Hours Dropdown Menu" title="Library Hours Dropdown Menu">
  <br>
  <p>
    Another thing about the menu is that generally, when a user clicks off a
    menu, more often than note, that menu will close. The drop-down menu for
    the hours does not close until the “Close X” button is clicked, which also
    feels like a lack of thought.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Most everything else about the site, however, feels natural and operates
    as one would expect of it. The site is built so that it effectively conveys
    ideas and concepts that would be familiar to most internet users. As far as
    I have been able to tell, the site is able to predict user interaction and
    deal with responses. I am unable to make the site “break”.</p>

  <br>
<b> Sections IV: Scope </b>
  <p>
    According to Garrett, the question to be answered on the scope plane is
    “What are we going to make?” In order to determine to scope of the website,
    it must be divided into the product as functionality, and product as
    information.</p>
  <br>
    The Functional Specifications of the website:
    <ul>
      <li>
        It must be able to be searchable
      </li>
      <li>
        It must have lists of resources available
      </li>
      <li>
        It must have a list of services that are available
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Information Specifications of the website:
      <ul>
        <li>
          It must be UCSB branded
        </li>
        <li>
          It must communicate the concept of the library
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Regarding function, the website works as it would be expected to. The search function works as expected and allows the user to easily search different databases. Most of the resources and services available are listed on the main page or can be accessed through one or two links from therein page. The page clearly demonstrates the University’s brand, which is immediately communicated upon viewing the website, which is done through several outlets: the brand guide colors and the logo of the University.</p>
    <br>
      <p>The word "library" or some variation thereof is found 12 times on the main page. Upon viewing the page, the user is greeted with a host of services and a large search bar advertising “Search articles, books, and more”.
  </p>
  <br>
<b> Sections V: Strategy </b>
  <p>
    Garrett says that in order to examine the Strategy plane, we must pose the question: Why are we making this product?” And in order to answer that, we must ask two more questions: What does the library need to get out of the website and what do the users need to get out of it?</p>
  <p>
    The library needs a website that facilitates a successful user experience
    and the users need a website that is a usable product, carefully designed
    with the intention of them utilizing it as a functional library website.</p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, the website is designed with the user in mind, allowing it to
    facilitate a successful user experience. From the user's point of view,
    it is easy to navigate and make sue of the resources and services offered
    by the library. The site is responsive and interactive and the different
    sections are clearly marked. It contains an effective underlying strategy
    which sets the rest of the website up for success.
