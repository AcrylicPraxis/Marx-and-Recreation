  For this evaluation, I will be reviewing the library website for the <a href="https://zsr.wfu.edu" 
  alt= "Link to the Z. Smith Reynolds Library Website" title= "Link to the Z. Smith Reynolds Library Website" 
  target=" blank"> Z. Smith Reynolds Library </a> on the Wake Forest University Campus. I have a connection with this 
  website as I used it more than any other site during my first graduate program at Wake Forest. 
  It is an easily navigable, clearly thought-out site that, in my opinion is very user 
  friendly. However, let us see how it stacks up against my chosen Law of User Experience: 
  The Law of Common Region.
  </p>
  <br>
<b> Section I: Definitions </b>
  <p>
  To begin with, we must have some definitions in place in order to define just what I am talking about.
  <br>
  According to <a href="https://lawsofux.com" alt= "Link to the Laws of UX Website" 
  title= "Link to the Laws of UX Website" target=" blank"> lawsofux.com,</a> the definition 
  of The Law of Common Region is: “Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area 
  with a clearly defined boundary.” This seems simple enough - the elements of a website will be mentally 
  grouped together by the user if they share a boundary. The principles of grouping, also known as Gestalt 
  laws of grouping are based on psychological principles. If you are like me, you had to look up the meaning 
  of “Gestalt”. According to Merriam-Webster, gestalt means “something that is made of many parts and yet is 
  somehow more than or different from the combination of its parts.” However, the German word, “gestalt” 
  simply means “shape” or “form”. Gestalt Principles, however, “aim to formulate the regularities according 
  to which the perceptual input is organized into unitary forms, also referred to as (sub)wholes, groups, 
  groupings, or Gestalten (the plural form of Gestalt).”
  <br>
  So what does this mean in association with the Law of Common Region?
  <br>
  It means that according to visual perception, grouping is important and usually comes naturally to the user 
  and increases the possibility of the user accepting the website as a usable interface. “In web design, 
  organising the elements of a page on the basis of GP [Gestalt Principles] seem to be a promising, effective 
  approach to improve perception. ‘Gestalt’ ‘refers to a structure, configuration or layout that is unified 
  and has specific properties that are greater than the simple sum of its individual parts’. According to 
  the Gestalt approach, the visual system follows certain grouping principles, including common fate, good 
  continuation, proximity and similarity.” (Möller & Unz)
  <br>
  An important aspect included in Gestalt grouping that the mind can rely on is symmetry. 
  "Symmetry gives us a feeling of solidity and order, which we tend to seek. It’s our nature to impose 
  order on chaos. This principle leads us to want balance in composition, though our compositions don’t 
  need to be perfectly symmetrical to be in balance.”(Design Principles, Visual Perception, 
  and the Principles of Gestalt, 2014)The home page of the ZSR website relies on symmetry to aid in 
  the grouping of objects. So with all this in mind, let us begin to examine the page itself.
  </p>
 <br>
<b> Section II: Examination </b>
 <p>
  My first impression when pulling up the page is that it is clean. In reality, there is a lot of 
  information that is confronted with the user, however, due to the regions presented, everything 
  has the feel of being neat and ordered without being overwhelming. 
  <br>
  The header of the page presents some basic information, such as the hours for the day, as 
  well as three drop-down menus to act as a quick reference for locating things. Below the header 
  is the search bar. It is large and fills nearly the entire width of the page, so it cannot be 
  overlooked. Below the search bar is the feature that I would like to focus on: three large dark gray boxes.
 <hr />
 <img src="eval4/Common Region Example.png" alt="The boxes are a good example of the Law of Common Region" 
  title="Example of Common Region">
 <hr />
  The section on the left contains links to many different kinds of information that are not necessarily 
 related. However, they are all grouped together in the box and under the heading “How Do I…?” Which 
 suddenly gives them all context and coherency.
 <br>
  The middle box is more straight forward in that it is a “help section”.
 <br>
  Finally, the box on the right is a section about news and events at the library.
 <br>
  These three sections all contain different types and amounts of information, but because they are 
  all grouped in identical boxes and placed evenly across the page, it is balanced and aids with user 
  flow and navigation.
 <br>
  If we continue down the page, we can see that in the next section, designed to display the library’s 
  social media presence, a similar concept is employed. However instead of physical boxes utilized 
  to group information, the idea of proximity is used as a boundary.
 <hr />
 <img src="eval4/Common Region Example 2.png" alt="While these three regions are not bound by boxes,
 they are still in a proximity grouping that the mind understands." title="Example of proximity as Common Region"
 <hr />
 As you continue further down the page to the bottom "table of contents" as it is called, you will see that there 
 is an interesting blending of common region with specified boundaries and proximity. 
  <hr />
 <img src="eval4/Common Region Hybrid.png" alt="This image provides an example of a blending of boundaries and proximity
 in common region." title="Example Hybrid Common Region"
 <hr />
 Each of the 8 sections have a gold line at the top, but no other border. Each section is identical in format: 
 6 links plus a "more information" link and each seciton is evenly spaced, giving the mind a concrete feeling of 
 different sections with concrete boundaries, even though there are none.
<br>
Overall, I really like the formatting of the ZSR website and I think that it makes extremely effective use of 
the law of Common Region.
